## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS 
- Flexbox

### What I learned

i'm think this learned me alot aobut how to style yur html in terms of containers that make a sense. also taught me flexbox. 

### Continued development

I wanna learned fast but smart, so also when do i move on from html css, js to reactm, typescript next, and so on?
